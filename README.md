### Conventions for Toolkits
#### Group name convention, and why it matter

- Must include a group name `toolkits`: The parser will know to look after toolkits in the svg structure.
    - Each `toolkit` must be named `toolkit default the_toolkit_name`: The parser will parse each group as individual toolkit. 

        - The word `default` is non mandatory, and is used to indicate that the toolkit will include the default tookit. The Â `the_toolkit_name` is the toolkit name. i.e: `toolkit default summer 2017` is the id of a `toolkit` including the `default` toolkit, named `summer 2017`.  
        
        - Each `toolkit` must have a group name `colors`: The parser will search for colors informations for this toolkit.  
            - Inside a `colors` group each colored rectangle is a declared color : The parser will know the RGB value of this color  
            - Each colored rectangle must have an `id` including the colorType, selected amongst (but not limited to) the following `background, cover, coverbackground, font` (in lowercase) : The parser will know the *colorType* of this color.
        - Each `toolkit` group must have a group name `fonts`: The parser will search for fonts informations for this toolkit.  
            - Inside a `fonts` group, each font is declared, by writing a text **using the desired font** : The parser will know the *font name* used by this writing.  
        - Each `toolkit` group must have a group name `images`: The parser will search for images informations for this toolkit.
            - Inside a `images` group, each image is a declared image: The parser will add each image to the tookit
            - Each image must have an `id` include the imageType, selected amongst (but not limited to) the following
